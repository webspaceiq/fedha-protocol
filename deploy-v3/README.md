# Aave V3 Deployments

[![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@aave/deploy-v3)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aave/deploy-v3)

This Node.js repository contains the configuration and deployment scripts for the Aave V3 protocol core and periphery contracts. The repository makes use of `hardhat` and `hardhat-deploy` tools to facilitate the deployment of Aave V3 protocol.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 16
- Alchemy or Infura API key
  - If you use a custom RPC node, you can change the default RPC provider URL at [./helpers/hardhat-config-helpers.ts:25](./helpers/hardhat-config-helpers.ts).
- Etherscan API key _(Optional)_

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.JS dependencies:

   ```
   npm i
   ```

2. Compile contracts before running any other command, to generate Typechain TS typings:

   ```
   npm run compile
   ```
